h2. FFMpeg

  A DSL for building and executing ffmpeg commands.

h2. Requirements

  It requires that you already have ffmpeg installed, obviously :)

h2. Install

  gem install polly-ffmpeg --source http://gems.github.com

h2. Usage

  To build and execute a command you would use the FFMpeg::convert method and then call the FFMpeg::run method like this:

    include FFMpeg

    convert "file.ext", :to => "new_file.ext" do
      seek     "00:01:13"
      duration "00:10:01"
    end.run

  For more information checkout the "documentation":http://polly.github.com/ffmpeg/

h2. Credit where credit's due

  Thank's to "jwthompson2":http://github.com/jwthompson2, there's now support for all of the standard video and 
  audio options from the ffmpeg documentation as well as improved and refactored specs.
